This repository contains implementations and test cases for various data structures and algorithms. Below is a list of all files with a brief explanation of their purpose.

## Implementation Files
- **ArrayList.py**: Implements a dynamic array (ArrayList) with methods for adding, removing, and resizing.
- **BFS.py**: Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and unweighted shortest path algorithms for graphs.
- **BinarySearchtress.py**: Implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with insertion and search functionalities.
- **DeQueue.py**: Implements a double-ended queue (Deque) with dynamic resizing.
- **DFS.py**: Implements Depth-First Search (DFS) for graph traversal.
- **doublelyLinkedList.py**: Implements a doubly linked list with methods for adding, removing, and converting to a list.
- **Graphs.py**: Implements an undirected graph with methods for adding edges, calculating degrees, and displaying the graph.
- **HashTables.py**: Implements a hash table with chaining for collision resolution and dynamic resizing.
- **LinkedList.py**: Implements a singly linked list with methods for adding, removing, and printing elements.
- **PriorityQueue.py**: Implements a priority queue using a min-heap.
- **RBTrees.py**: Implements a Red-Black Tree with insertion and search functionalities.
